                Stans's tourist trap, the Mystery Shack, with his twin sister Mabel. In comparison to Mabel, Dipper
                is the less outgoing of the pair and has a nerdy side. When he finds a mysterious
                and anonymously written journal in the woods that documents the odd and paranormal of Gravity Falls,
                Dipper's summer goal is to find The Author. His longing for adventure sometimes backfires though,
                as things in Gravity Falls sometimes are not as they seem, and leads to certain...

                free-spirited
                personality and a heart of gold. She's excited to spend the summer at Mystery Shack with her brother
                Dipper. Mabel loves to wear many different styled sweaters that she makes
                herself, made fast friends with Gravity Falls locals Candy Chu and Grenda Grendinator, and has a
                pet pig named Waddles! While Mable doesn't always see eye to eye with Dipper, she truly cares about
                her brother and has fun hanging out with him. As long as there isn't a cute boy distracting her.

            <p class='mainP'>Great Uncle Stan is the owner and main tour guide of Gravity Falls' one and only Mystery
                Shack.
                One part home and one part weird specimens and oddities museum, the Shack is how Stan, the ultimate
                conman, makes his income. Stan often abuses the fact that he's an old man to get out of unsavory
                situations that he himself has gotten into. His love of money and questionable business practices
                rivals that of Mr.Krabs. Loves his nephew and niece Dipper and Mabel, but is by no means a role
                model for them, having a very loose sense of <span onmouseenter="Mystery(this)">
