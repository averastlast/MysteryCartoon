            <p class='mainP'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gravity Falls, Oregon, is a mysterious, sleepy, small town of eastern
                Oregon, where
                there are many supernatural occurrences. It was founded by Quentin Trembley, but in an attempt to cover
                it up was said to be founded by Nathaniel Northwest. It's where Stan Pines lives and runs the Mystery
                Shack, a tourist trap which overcharges unlucky visitors for a glimpse at the world's most bizarre
                museum. 12-year-old twin siblings Dipper and Mabel Pines, who are Stan's greatnephew and greatniece, are
                sent to stay with Stan for the summer, which leads them to discover the different yet curious wonders of
                Gravity Falls.</p>
