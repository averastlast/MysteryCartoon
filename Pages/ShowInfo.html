            <p class='mainP'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gravity Falls is an American animated television
                series produced by Disney
                Television Animation for Disney Channel and Disney XD from June 15, 2012, to February 15,
                2016. The series creator is Alex Hirsch, and loosely bases Dipper and Mabel after himself and his
                actual twin sister Ariel. While growing up, the two would spend their summer vacations in a
                cabin with relatives, which inspired the setting and scenario for Gravity Falls. Alex Hirsch also
                included certain attributes of his sister in Mabelâ€™s character, such as her love of boy bands and goofy
                sweaters. Alex Hirsch also voices several characters on the show, including Grunkle Stan, Soos,
                and <span onmouseenter="Hey(this)"> Bill.</span></p>
